abstract = {Recent work shows that the Rowhammer hardware bug can be used to craft powerful attacks and completely subvert a system. However, existing efforts either describe probabilistic (and thus unreliable) attacks or rely on special (and often unavailable) memory management features to place victim objects in vulnerable physical memory locations. Moreover, prior work only targets x86 and researchers have openly wondered whether Rowhammer attacks on other architectures, such as ARM, are even possible. We show that deterministic Rowhammer attacks are feasible on commodity mobile platforms and that they cannot be mitigated by current defenses. Rather than assuming special memory management features, our attack, DRAMMER, solely relies on the predictable memory reuse patterns of standard physical memory allocators. We implement DRAMMER on Android/ARM, demonstrating the practicability of our attack, but also discuss a generalization of our approach to other Linux-based platforms. Furthermore, we show that traditional x86-based Rowhammer exploitation techniques no longer work on mobile platforms and address the resulting challenges towards practical mobile Rowhammer attacks.To support our claims, we present the first Rowhammer-based Android root exploit relying on no software vulnerability, and requiring no user permissions. In addition, we present an analysis of several popular smartphones and find that many of them are susceptible to our DRAMMER attack. We conclude by discussing potential mitigation strategies and urging our community to address the concrete threat of faulty DRAM chips in widespread commodity platforms.},

abstract = {The Fifth Generation (5 G) networks exhibit high flexibility and diversity in their design and deployment strategies. Transitions between base stations (BSs), heterogeneous networks (HetNets) and other cellular networks provide significant vulnerabilities and expose users to substantial risks associated with cybersecurity attacks. This article evaluates current handover authentication methods in the context of 5 G networks while proposing a set of security criteria for handover authentication. This study presents a novel authentication technique called SHK (Secure Handover Key) that utilizes SDNs (Software Defined networks). The proposed scheme integrates recycled lightweight dynamic key cryptography and combines security features such as perfect forward secrecy and robustness to leakages. The significance of the proposed approach is assessed in terms of computations, communications, signals, and energy costs on 5 G mobility applications and Vehicular Communication Networks (VCNs). The scheme employed in this study demonstrates enhanced security measures and improved changeover performance compared to conventional schemes.}

Despite the emergence of large-scale testbeds for network research, simulation still plays a vital role in terms of scalability (both in size and in experimental speed), reproducibility, rapid prototyping, and education. With simulation based studies, the approach can be studied in detail at varying scales, with varying data applications, varying field conditions, and will result in reproducible and analyzable results.",

abstract = {Summary This chapter outlines the reference architectures conceived for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) planning and deployment in Europe, their evolution through the inputs provided by major ITS projects and initiatives and some experiences from the authors when facing the definition of ITS architectures through their involvement in research projects such as Cybercars-2 and MoveUs, by following different approaches. In view of the project's ambitious goals, the definition of an architecture supporting the cloud platform operation and the delivery of mobility services envisaged, with a predominant role of ITS, entailed a huge effort. The main objective was to define a comprehensive architecture for the MoveUs cloud-based platform, the specifications of its core facilities and the high- level interfaces between the different platform components. The methodology adopted to define the specifications of this platform integrated insights and approaches from different engineering fields: traffic engineering, data analytics, software architecting and cloud-based computation deployment.}

The development of vehicular communication networks has created a variety of emergency services and applications. A vehicular access network is often classified into vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. There are many special cases and scenarios dedicated purely to either V2I or V2V. The chapter explains V2I and V2V, as well as related hybrid combinations one by one. The concepts of V2V and V2I networking of vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) are based on local area networking, exploiting typically an IEEE 802.11p standard based access network. The straightforward approach for the handover in hybrid vehicular networking entity is to always promote VANET networking whenever available, and whenever arriving into the range of another vehicular networking unit, with the price of breaking up the ongoing cellular network data transfer.}

For this purpose, it presents a proposal of a deterministic MAC protocol, the vehicular flexible time-triggered (V-FTT), which adopts a master multislave time division multiple access (TDMA), in which the roadside units act as masters to schedule the transmissions of the on-board units. The chapter next reviews infrastructure based vehicle communications proposed solutions. It also considers the scenario of motorways near urban areas, since it is common for this type of motorway to have peak hours of large traffic with vehicles travelling at high speeds. The chapter presents a possible model for road side unit (RSU) deployment. Finally, the chapter describes how V-FTT can be supported by the IEEE 802.11p/WAVE standard for vehicular communications.}

In order to define security and safety requirements it is first necessary to have an understanding of both the intended behaviour of the system and the intended operating environment. This can be achieved through analysis of a range of representative use cases. Risk analysis is essential for cost-effective security engineering, as it provides an objective basis for judging whether the implementation of security features to address the security requirements identified from the threat analysis is justified in terms of the perceived risks. The chapter explains a unified approach to risk analysis that takes account of both security and security-related safety aspects, and cyber security risk management.}

This chapter focuses on the study of electromagnetic (EM) fields generated by antennas that are found mainly within the vehicle cabin. It outlines the behaviour of EM fields within such resonant environments and possible implications for intelligent transport systems (ITS). The chapter first briefly describes the present state of art of channel characterization and in-vehicle EM field investigations, and then introduces software tools and techniques used to perform in-vehicle field simulations. Next, it describes the use of a novel low disturbance scanner used for experimental validation. An investigation of the effects of field distribution within the cabin of the vehicle due to different placement locations of the source antenna is presented. The chapter also discusses human exposure issues and possible EM field mitigation techniques.}

It starts with the definition of the TMS, followed by a depiction of different traffic environments on which TMS operates. Although ITS involve multiple transport modes, the chapter focuses on roads. It presents a traffic management framework. This framework can be structured as involving inputs, data analysis and outputs. Several inputs sources could be used: traffic counters, tolling systems, flow meters, weather stations, CCTV and nomadic devices, among others. The core where all is coordinated is the traffic management centre (TMC), a real time management component of a much wider and longer running process. TMS is the platform that provides access to inputs, results of analysis and allows sending outputs/actions. Finally, the chapter overviews two opposite architectures commonly used for TMS platforms, both client-server based: event based and data-store.}

Cooperative systems in transport provide great possibilities. The main characteristics of a cooperative approach are: considering the driver, vehicle, infrastructure and other road users as a unique system; considering operational and management needs of the entire system; integrated approach to safety of traffic and all participants; and applying a technology in a coherent manner in order to support overall integration of system parts. This chapter describes examples of the cooperative approach application in urban traffic: cooperative ramp metering, incident management in urban areas and public transport cooperative priorities. The European Union has recently invested significant effort to prevent duplication of activities, not only within the EU, but worldwide (USA, Japan, China).}

This chapter explains the generic methodology of the intelligent information management system (IIMS) implemented in a traffic information system. The proposed methodology for the IIMS is validated with the onboard module's prototype. In this case, the inputs are the static and dynamic messages sent by beacons located along the infrastructure of the road, and then, received on the vehicle by the onboard module. The chapter describes the three functional models employed in the IIMS: the signal model, the interpretation model, and the representation model. The performance of the IIMS has been highlighted for different driving situations defined by different traffic density levels, meteorological conditions and vehicle speeds.}

@article{Palaniswamy2020,
   abstract = {Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) services use a range of information, such as traffic conditions and location information, for safe and convenient driving. Information exchange in VANET happens in Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication modes. Several V2I and V2V authentication protocol suites are proposed to protect the information from attacks, namely replay, masquerading and man-in-the-middle. This paper identifies critical weaknesses in the protocols proposed for V2I and V2V communication modes and proposes a new protocol suite as a countermeasure. Our protocol suite is composed of driver authentication, V2I and V2V key exchanges, information exchange, offline password change and vehicle complain protocols. Our V2I key exchange protocol facilitates handoff capability to ensure continuous authentication when vehicles move from the coverage of one roadside unit (RSU) to another. The protocol also assures detectability to denial-of-service (DoS). Our V2V key exchange protocol enables vehicles to verify the time-bounded validity of certificates of vehicles and integrity of keys. We use the random oracle model to prove the security of our key exchange protocols and prove various security attributes of the protocols informally. Tamarin tool is used to formally verify the security properties of our driver authentication and key exchange protocols. Performance comparisons show that our driver authentication and key exchange protocols assure lesser computation overhead and more functional attributes than the existing protocols. Simulation performance ensures the fast key dissemination capability of our protocol suite.},

   abstract = {In the last decade, there has been growing interest in Vehicular Ad Hoc NETworks (VANETs). Today car manufacturers have already started to equip vehicles with sophisticated sensors that can provide many assistive features such as front collision avoidance, automatic lane tracking, partial autonomous driving, suggestive lane changing, and so on. Such technological advancements are enabling the adoption of VANETs not only to provide safer and more comfortable driving experience but also provide many other useful services to the driver as well as passengers of a vehicle. However, privacy, authentication and secure message dissemination are some of the main issues that need to be thoroughly addressed and solved for the widespread adoption/deployment of VANETs. Given the importance of these issues, researchers have spent a lot of effort in these areas over the last decade. We present an overview of the following issues that arise in VANETs: privacy, authentication, and secure message dissemination. Then we present a comprehensive review of various solutions proposed in the last 10 years which address these issues. Our survey sheds light on some open issues that need to be addressed in the future.},

abstract = {Abstract Vehicular communications networks form the backbone of cooperative intelligent transport systems to support road safety and infotainment applications amongst users. IEEE 802.11p of the Dedicated Short-Range Communications protocol stack has been the technology of choice for Vehicle-to-Everything communications within the United States and Japan and has been extensively trailed in other countries such as Australia. With the advent of cellular technologies, a new, competing cellular-based Device-to-Device technology, known as Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything Sidelink, has emerged. Considering both technologies suffer from performance limitations, there is a current debate as to which of these technologies will eventually dominate the cooperative intelligent transport systems landscape if they cannot coexist. To investigate mechanisms of spectrum sharing between Dedicated Short-Range Communications and Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything for deployment in a common region, this paper initially reviews the background and technicalities of both technologies. The paper subsequently sets forth Vehicle-to-Everything platform models that allow not only spectrum sharing at the ITS band but also concurrent and simultaneous propagations of Dedicated Short-Range Communications and Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything messages. The transmission and reception mechanisms of hybrid Vehicle-to-Everything platforms are verified through a describing function model.},

abstract = {The OMNeT++ discrete event simulation environment has been publicly available since 1997. It has been created with the simulation of communication networks, multiprocessors and other distributed systems in mind as application area, but instead of building a specialized simulator, OMNeT++ was designed to be as general as possible. Since then, the idea has proven to work, and OMNeT++ has been used in numerous domains from queuing network simulations to wireless and ad-hoc network simulations, from business process simulation to peer-to-peer network, optical switch and storage area network simulations. This paper presents an overview of the OMNeT++ framework, recent challenges brought about by the growing amount and complexity of third party simulation models, and the solutions we introduce in the next major revision of the simulation framework.},

abstract = {We analyze the properties of line of sight (LOS) channels in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We use V2V measurements performed in open space, suburban, and urban environments. By separating LOS from non-LOS data, we show that a two-ray ground reflection path loss model with effective reflection coefficient range fits the LOS channels better than the frequently used free space path loss model. Two-ray model is a better fit not only in open space, but also in suburban and urban environments. We investigate the impact of using the modified two-ray model on the application-level performance metrics: packet delivery rate, throughput, latency, and jitter. Our results show that considerable differences arise in application performance when using the modified two-ray and free space models.},

abstract = {Introduced with LTE Release 14, Cellular V2X enables device-to-device communication to support road safety and traffic efficiency applications. We present Artery-C, a simulation framework for the performance evaluation of Cellular V2X protocols and V2X applications. Our simulator relies on the simulation framework SimuLTE and substantially extends it by implementing control and user planes, a dedicated sidelink interface with specific focus on dynamic mode switching and some advanced features of 5G mobile networks, such as variable numerologies. Artery-C integrates seamlessly into the simulation framework Artery, which enables the simulation of standardized V2X messages at the facilities layer as well as the coupling to the mobility simulator SUMO. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of Artery-C, we evaluate V2X-based platooning as a representative use case and present results for mode 3, mode 4 and mode switching in a highway scenario.},
